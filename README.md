### About Me:
Iâ€™ve been passionate about technology for as long as I can remember, starting with gaming on old Windows XP and 2000 systems. I have a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in Physics with a strong focus in mathematics. I am interested in Cybersecurity due to my strong background in complex problem solving, computational modeling as well as my passion for technology.
